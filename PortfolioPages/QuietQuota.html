                Quiet Quota is an Isometric stealth game created as part of the Collaborative games development module at The University of Staffordshire.
                In this module we were matched into teams based on skillset and disciplines containing students from the Stoke and London campuses with the goal to create a vertical slice of a game.
                This project allowed for close communication between members and familiarity in a collaborative environment.

                            This tool was made so that we could randomise levels to make the game different on each playthrough, 
                            whilst still allowing designers to plan rooms based on their environments. 
                            Each designer that creates a room would have to fill a RoomID corresponding to the space in the level that they want to fill, these ID persist in the level and have rooms that can spawn in via data assets.<br>
                            At runtime the level will randomly stream a room section from the rooms linked to an ID.<br>
                            Sadly due to time constraints this wasn't used and was left out from the project.

                            This mechanic was made in the last 48 hours of the project deadline which meant it wouldn't make it into the final game. 
                            I was requested to make this component for the game and i made it fully modular with other UI elements and it needed to be implemented
                            on the UI HUD which was currently checked out on the source control so i was unable to implement it. 
                            This worked on inputs as to not use tick, (Tick was used for debugging purposes in this instance)

                        <p class="text-size-2">
                            I made a rudamentary modular equipment system which allowed for more abilities to be created post development if needed.
                            This system allows for weapons and consumables by spawning an object at runtime which can be accessed by the Equipment System manager,
                            the manager will handle usage of abilities and checks against the equipment type class to update values on the UI. 
                            This will be for if equipment has a counter or if the item is on cooldown.

                        <p class="text-size-2">
                            I was in charge of a large part of the project by being entrusted to create the AI, i was tasked with creating AI Detection. 
                            For this i used the AI Perception component, the depth of this mechanic was detection speed based on distance and the AI would stop to watch you.
                            I programmed in a chase behaviour and a search behaviour but the Leads for the game would not want this mechanic so i had removed it by final release.
